Blockchain back-end electronic health records (EHRs).
We want to build an application using blockchain technology, specifically designed to be an access-point for migrants and refugees to their health records. The application is relevant for health care facilities and workers providing services for the migrating population. We are not aiming to replace current systems used by these facilities, but to provide an easy point of access to health information that is safe, reliable and can be used in the daily running of a clinic. Using the application can save time for health care workers by eliminating need to collect information verbally, whilst also giving migrants and refugees autonomy over their own health data.
